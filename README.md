# JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Background

In this project I used Javascript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js to build a website that presents alient data. 

* I created a basic HTML web page. 

* I used the UFO dataset in the form of an array of JavaScript objects and wrote code that appended a table to my web page and then added new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

* I used a date form in your HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that listened for events and searched through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.


## Built With
* HTML
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap
* CSS
* D3.js
